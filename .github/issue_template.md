Thank you for your effort to improve this module!

**The xml module is upstream now and ships with Ansible v2.4 which is to be released in [mid-September](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/rst/roadmap/ROADMAP_2_4.rst).**

Please try running [ansible from source](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#running-from-source), and see if the issue is already fixed. Note that you'll need version of lxml>=2.3.0. If the issue still exists, please search for it [upstream](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues) and report it there if it's not already reported.
